Though it’s tempting to think of Bollingen Tower as a vacation home, if we put it
into the context of Jung’s career at this point it’s clear that the lakeside retreat was not
built as an escape from work. In 1922, when Jung bought the property, he could not
afford to take a vacation. Only one year earlier, in 1921, he had published
Psychological Types, a seminal book that solidified many differences that had been
long developing between Jung’s thinking and the ideas of his onetime friend and
mentor, Sigmund Freud. To disagree with Freud in the 1920s was a bold move. To
back up his book, Jung needed to stay sharp and produce a stream of smart articles and
books further supporting and establishing analytical psychology, the eventual name
for his new school of thought.
